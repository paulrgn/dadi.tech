          "description": "You can consider **DADI API** as the data layer within a platform (including the data model). It is designed to be plugged into a templating layer, a mobile application or to be used with any other data consumer.\n\nCalls to a **DADI API** can contain your business/domain logic (the part of a platform that encodes the real-world business rules that determine how data is created, displayed, stored and changed). It has full support for searching, filtering, limiting, sorting, offsetting, input validation and data aggregation (Map-reduce).\n\n**DADI API** provides a starting point that's further advanced than a framework. It allows you to get a complete data layer up and running in seconds.
