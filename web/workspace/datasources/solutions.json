For every one page created by an author, one page is displayed to the user – in the very same non-scalable way editorial staff work with InDesign to create layouts for the press.\n\nDADI is different. It abstracts content storage from presentation in support of the [COPE philosophy](/technology/concepts/api-first-and-cope) – the author Creates Once but Publishes Everywhere. In other words, DADI stores raw content for reuse across multiple products, from responsive websites to mobile, tablet and TV apps. This means writers spend more time writing than playing admin to the words and media they create.\n\n## Making sense of content\n\nUtilise our machine learning tools and developed ontologies to automatically and consistently tag your content to facilitate data driven experiences at scale."

With DADI you can treat products as if alive – nurture and adjust against a KPI-driven roadmap based on what actually works, rather than gambling on the ‘hit and hope’ big bang release."

If your user only ever looks at content about apples, why not hide the pears? Serve myriad versions of your product to your varied audience based on preference.\n\nAdd Predict – DADI’s machine learning technology – into the mix and you can foresee which other fruits your users may be interested in. This means a tailored editorial strategy driven by evidence rather than the (still important) editorial nose on its own."
