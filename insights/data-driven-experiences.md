title: Building Relationships in a Data-Driven World
author: Christopher Mair
preface: Brands who put customer data at the heart of their business have the potential to deliver what we call 'data-driven experiences’. Data driven experiences present users with content which is more likely to appeal to them, based on what is known about them individually. The more compelling it is, the better it will perform.

Data-driven experiences can occur in a multitude of places, providing the possibility exists to identify an individual - most commonly through the device they are using - and there is an active Internet connection.

Data-driven marketing has long been the holy grail for marketers, but has only recently become a reality to them. Marketing technology, automation, and advanced analytics techniques have unlocked the ability to personalise at scale. And only now are we starting to witness the emergence of systems capable of delivering genuine data-driven experiences.

There are three key ingredients for making this happen. Firstly more advanced customer data platforms, which integrate all known customer data including first-party data, customer-supplied data and purchase history, website or app behaviour, and marketing response and engagement information, with third-party data on customer interests and shopping behaviour, to improve individual targeting. Secondly, more advanced analytics models for propensity scoring each individual customer. And finally the ability to use customer data to trigger personalised ads, distribute specific content, offers, or experiences across channels - meaning a system has to place equal weight on the value of content and the value of user data.

Business benefits include:

* The foundation of long term, mutually beneficial customer relationships
* Enables a new, more accurate approach to business strategy
* Potential to unlock new revenue streams
* Makes content work harder, and perform better * Single customer view cross-channel

Customer benefits include:

* Personalised real-time experiences tailored to them individually
* Consistent cross-channel experiences

For brands to make data-driven experiences a reality, there are three things they need to do. Firstly they need to develop a data strategy relevant to their business objectives. Secondly they must invest in the requisite technologies to enable data-driven experiences. Only platforms such as the DADI platform, that places equal weight on the value of content and the value of user data, can deliver genuine data-driven experiences. Thirdly they need to deploy the relevant data-driven solutions, this could be in the form of a tool, an app, a website or whatever.
